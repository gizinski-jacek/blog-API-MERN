# Blog API MERN

Blog MERN app built with React as frontend client, Node/Express as backend server, MongoDB for data storage, and using Heroku to host it online.

Made to practice working with frontend to backend communication and furthering my knowledge on user authentication with PassportJS using JWT.

###### This project is being actively worked on.
